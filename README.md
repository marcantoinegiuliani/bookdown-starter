# bookdown-starter

This repository contains a basic template to start your own bookdown. It is based on the following ressources:

* https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ (the bookdown book)
* https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo (basic template)
* http://seankross.com/2016/11/17/How-to-Start-a-Bookdown-Book.html (a blog post)
* https://github.com/seankross/bookdown-start (another bookdown template, simpler)

The important files are:

* _bookdown.yml which mostly states the order of the different mardown files in the global document
* style.css for better styling
* _output.yml which allows to specify the compilation tools and extra title infos
